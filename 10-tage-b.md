I got my first diary before I could even read. My father gave it to me on my sixth birthday and I still remember the look on his face when he told me with this no-nonsense, don't-you-dare-interrupt-me voice that he always used when he spoke about something that was absolutely unrelentingly serious to him (and I'm praraphrasing here, he spoke Hebrew of course and I wouldn't trust these now 17 year old memories too much)

At the time, this had seemed very odd to me. I struggeled to understand why grown-ups placed such importance on these things that had no pictures but strange scribbelings in them, and one that was completely blank just made no sense to me. Maybe it was the tone of my father's voice, but something convinced me not to whine about the seemingly lousy birthday present but rather to keep it, somehow excited to find out what this would be all about.

And find out I did, soon after. I learned to read and write and took to it naturally. After all, I had the encouragement of my father, himself an accomplished newspaper journalist, something that had always been very important to me. I didn't start to write in that original diary until later, out of fear of sullying the pages with the crude and unpracticed letters of my untrained hands. Come to think of it, even though I've pretty much mastered and evidently also abandoned that skill by now, I still struggle to write in that book for fear of ruining it with clumsy and unimportant words instead. Maybe father's words were a bit to effective in that regard: They created an aura of importance about that book, so now I reserve it for only the most important of matters, and have resorted to first filling up boxes with notebooks and then the harddrives of my electronic devices for the trivialities of life. Naturally the original isn't even half-full yet. And the things in it are mostly sad of nature, so probably that's a good thing.

It was not by chance that my father had phrased what he said back then as vaguely as he did. It was a smart ploy of his to entice me to look for said power in the empty pages. He probably hadn't known himself what I'd come up with, but I think him being a journalist he had wanted to nudge me in the direction of improving the world by means of exchanging information. I suppose he succeeded in that regard, in some way, because now I study (or at least used to study) telecommunications engineering here in the UK. But I have also found another power in writing, especially in a diary: To me, it is healing. It is my own, self-administered psychotherapy. A place to go to when I need to collect myself, where I can be myself, unapollogetically and brutally honest. The diary doesn't judge -- which is not to say that the words don't -- but it is always my own idiosyncrasies reflected on the pages; not unlike I need a mirror to look onto my face, I need the diary to look into my mind. It has, for the better part of my life, been most useful in maintaining my mental health and emotional wellbeing.

Which is why I turn to it now in this time of struggle and hardship. I have been expelled from my home, have lost contact to my family, a friend was beaten to death in front of my eyes and the world seems to have turned upside down. In front of me lies a many-houndred-kilometers journey off an locked-down island to a foreign country in search of a stranger who's gonna help me report the crime of the century. Whew.
